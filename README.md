# DnD_Radar_Chart_Comparison
## Objective 
Create a dropdown menu enabled comparison of randomly generated D & D characters using a Radar (AKA Spider, Star, or Polar Chart)
General Radar Chart info cand be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart), and [here](https://plotly.com/python/radar-chart/)

Random character generator were created [here](https://levi-blodgett.github.io/dnd-char-generator/) using "New Stat Roller Character" option.
Special shoutout to @levi-blodgett for his character generator!:clap:

After multiple attempts to create a Radar chart that could be used in conjunction with a Dropdown menu to compare randomly generated DnD Characters, it appears I will have to expand my knowldege and experience!ðŸ“š to create such a visualization. For the time being, a link to this my Tableau Public page [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mark.waananen/vizzes) contains a DnD Character Comparison story.
